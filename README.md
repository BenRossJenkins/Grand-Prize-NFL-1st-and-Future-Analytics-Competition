# Grand Prize NFL 1st and Future Analytics Competition
Provided here are some of my analyses in which I was selected as one of three finalists. The NFL competition was hosted on the crowdsourced data science platform Kaggle. We were tasked with investigating the relationship between the playing surface and the injury and performance of National Football League (NFL) athletes and to examine factors that may contribute to lower extremity injuries. I received the grand prize based on my work and presentation as judged by members of the NFL Health &amp; Safety Team.
